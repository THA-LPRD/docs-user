This guide covers the initial setup of your ePaper display module.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Your ePaper display module with battery inserted
- A device with WiFi capability and a web browser

## Initial Setup

The device comes pre-configured in Standalone mode, creating its own WiFi network.

### Connecting to the Device

<Steps>
    1. On your device, open WiFi settings
    2. Connect to the network named `LPRD-Display-XXXX` (where XXXX is a unique identifier)
    3. Enter the default password: `password`
    4. Wait for the connection to establish
</Steps>

### Accessing the Web Interface

<Steps>
    1. Open a web browser
    2. Navigate to `http://192.168.4.1`
    3. Log in with the default credentials:

        <div>
            - Username: `admin`
            - Password: `admin`
        </div>

    4. After successful login, you'll see the device's web interface
</Steps>

## Configuring Network Mode (Optional)

If you prefer to use the device on your existing WiFi network, refer to the [Settings](../../settings) page for instructions on changing the operating mode.

When using Network mode, you'll need to find the device's IP address through your router's DHCP client list to access it again.

## Power Management

The device is designed for low power consumption:

- The display automatically enters sleep mode after 5 minutes of inactivity
- While in sleep mode, the device cannot be accessed through WiFi
- To wake the device, press any of the physical buttons
- The device will resume operation and reactivate its network connection
